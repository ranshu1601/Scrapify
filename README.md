# Scrapify
A web scraping website using JavaScript to find the least priced product on e-commerce websites is an innovative idea that could provide a great user experience for those looking to save money on their online purchases. The use of a headless browser like ** Cheerio ** would allow for automated scraping of multiple e-commerce websites and enable the extraction of relevant product information, including the product name, price, and URL. Sorting this information by price would allow for easy identification of the least expensive product.
